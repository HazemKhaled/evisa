- **Deployment**: OpenNext.js for Cloudflare Workers integration
- **Analytics**: Sentry, Google Tag Manager, Jitsu integration planned

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✓ Major Feature Completion & Enhancement

- This is a substantial brownfield enhancement requiring comprehensive planning
- Multiple interconnected features across catalog and destination systems
- Architectural impact on existing foundation

**Enhancement Description**: Complete the implementation of the destination-driven visa catalog system, including destination pages with visa options, passport-based eligibility checking, travel blog content system, and comprehensive SEO optimization with sitemap generation.

**Impact Assessment**: ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes and additions required)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Complete destination catalog with visa eligibility checking functionality
• Launch comprehensive travel blog system with destination-focused content
• Deploy advanced SEO optimization including country-specific sitemaps
• Enable multilingual destination-specific content across 8 languages
• Establish solid foundation for post-MVP enhancements including future revenue features

**Background Context**: The platform has solid technical foundations with internationalization, database schema, and UI components implemented. However, the core business functionality - the destination catalog with visa eligibility checking - remains incomplete. The enhancement bridges the gap between technical foundation and business value delivery, transforming the platform from a static homepage into a comprehensive visa intelligence platform.
