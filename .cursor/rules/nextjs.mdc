# Frontend with Next.js

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Redux Tailwind.
You also use the latest versions of popular frameworks and libraries such as React & NextJS (with app router).
You provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

## Approach

- This project uses Next.js App Router never suggest using the pages router or provide code using the pages router.
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code.
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
- Use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router) in TypeScript.
- Use pnpm, not npm.

## Key Principles

- Focus on readability over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Be sure to reference file names.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
- Only write code that is necessary to complete the task.
- Rewrite the complete code only if necessary.
- Update relevant tests or create new tests if necessary.

## Next.js

- Use latest version Next.js 15.4.6 app router and follow Next.js best practices in every aspect.
- Keep maintaining code linting and style with Eslint & Prettier https\://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint
- Use the right rendering strategy for your page depending on the needs
- If a Google font used, make sure to use this package `next/font/google`
- Use next/dynamic, React.lazy() with Suspense when it's needed.
- Use MDX with all static pages (ex: about, terms and conditions, articles, etc.)
- Follow Next.js best practices in metadata, manifest.json, sitemap, JSON-LD, and robots.txt https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata
- All pages should include metadata and JSON-LD, should reflect the page content, and respect the page language.
- Create and keep maintaining sitemap.xml, robots.txt, manifest.json
- If multilingual is required, use next-intl 4.3.5

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Do not export `types` or `functions` unless you need to share it across multiple components
- Do not introduce new `types` or `values` to the global namespace.
- Consider defining a more specific interface for the additional properties or use a union type with known properties.
- Function parameters should have explicit TypeScript types.
- Using 'any[]' type reduces type safety. Consider defining a proper interface.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

## Comments

- When there are comments for `functions`, `interfaces`, `enums`, and `classes` use JSDoc style comments

## UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Focus on normal, clean UI design - do not implement dark mode or theme switching.
- Use Cairo font via `next/font/google`.
- Use Lucide React 0.542.0 for consistent iconography.

## Performance Optimization

- 'use client' over React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

## Content and Database

- All pages and functions should be functional with no placeholders.
- List content from database if available instead of dummy data.
- Always add real content and seed the database with real content.
- Use Drizzle ORM 0.44.5 with Cloudflare D1 SQLite database.
- Follow established database schema patterns for destinations, visa types, and articles.

## Internationalization

- Use next-intl 4.3.5 for multilingual content and routing.
- Full RTL support for RTL languages.
- Locale-based routing with `/[locale]/` structure.
- Always use the `useTranslations` hook for text content.
- Test both LTR and RTL layouts during development.

## Project Structure

Follow the established project structure:
```
src/
├── app/                          # Next.js App Router
│   ├── globals.css              # Global styles and design tokens
│   ├── layout.tsx               # Root layout
│   └── [locale]/                # Internationalized routes
├── components/                   # Reusable components
│   ├── layout/                  # Layout components
│   └── ui/                      # Base UI components
├── lib/                         # Utility libraries
│   ├── db/                      # Database configuration
│   └── utils.ts                 # Utility functions
└── i18n/                        # Internationalization
```

## Development Commands

- Use pnpm for package management
- Development: `pnpm dev` (with Turbopack)
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Database: `pnpm db:generate`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:studio`
- Code quality: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`

## Error Handling and Monitoring

- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Use Sentry 10.7.0 for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use TypeScript strict mode for better type safety

## SEO and Metadata

- Implement proper metadata for all pages
- Use structured data (JSON-LD) for better search visibility
- Ensure proper URL structures for internationalization
- Generate dynamic sitemaps for destinations and articles
- Use MDX for static content pages (about, articles, etc.)

## Git & GitHub

### When creating commit messages

Use conventional commit message format as following:

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Scope: Required, use slug for current module
- Description: use imperative, present tense ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Examples:
  - `fix(catalog): resolve null reference in address selection`
  - `docs(auth): update README with setup instructions`

### When creating pull request subjects

Use conventional commit for pull request subject as following:

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Always include Sentry issue links in the PR description when fixing bugs
- Scope: Required, use slug for current module
- Examples:
  - `feat(catalog): implement social login providers`
  - `fix(auth): add optional chaining to prevent null reference error`

### When creating branch names

Use the following format for branch names:

- **Format**: `<type>/<description>`
- **Types**:
  - `feature`: For new features.
  - `bugfix`: For bug fixes.
  - `chore`: For maintenance tasks.
- **Description**: A brief, human-readable description of the task, using kebab-case.

#### Examples:

- `feature/add-new-checkout-flow`
- `bugfix/gtm-event-name-normalization`
- `chore/move-to-pages`

This convention ensures clarity and traceability in our development process.

## Business Logic Phases

- Phase 1: Visa Catalog (current focus)
- Phase 2: Affiliate Integration
- Phase 3: Content Strategy
- Phase 4: In-house Services

Always refer to CLAUDE.md for comprehensive project guidance and maintain consistency with the established architecture and patterns.
